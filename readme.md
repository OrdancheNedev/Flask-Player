# Project Description


This web app is designed to analyze surveillance videos, specifically from abandoned buildings, to recognize people in them. The app integrates various technologies such as OpenCV, FaceNet, Flask, and Bootstrap, providing a seamless full-stack solution that demonstrates facial recognition, machine vision, and AI in action.

Built as a non-commercial research project by a college student, the goal is to showcase the potential of combining full-stack development with AI and machine vision in real-world applications. The app processes videos (usually 1-2 minutes long) to detect faces and identify people based on an uploaded image.
